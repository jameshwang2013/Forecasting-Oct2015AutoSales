# OPIM314-Internet-Data-Analytics----Assignment-1
Predicting US auto sales for October 2015 (as of September 30, 2015)

- please read through the assignment instructions in "Assignment 1--Google Trends"
- unfortunately, I was unable to recover the .csv files from Google Trends that I downloaded to run some of my regressions.
- I grabbed my data from --> Google Trends --> Explore -->  Time: Oct 2010 - Sep 2015 ... Categories: Autos & Vehicles
- the idea behind this assignment is that the changes in the amount of search queries for car/auto-related items can be a good predictor of US auto sales
